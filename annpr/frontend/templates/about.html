    <h3>ABOUT ANNPR</h3>

    <p>
        ANNPR(Automatic Nepali Number Plate Recognition System) is a system
        designed to detect Nepali number plates from images or videos and then
        to recognize the number plate. In this system we used YOLOv4 Darknet
        model for detecting number plates as well as for character segmentation.
        Then the segmented characters are recognized using a CNN model. The
        recognized license plate number will then be recorded in a database.
        We expect this system to work well with images. But in case of Video, we obtained very low FPS because we couldn't afford GPU and are using CPU for running the trained model. So Our system may not be used for real time video detection as of now but we are working hard and we will make this system realtime in future. This project was really challenging for us because we were new to this topic and we found very few implementations of such systems in case of Nepal, so we had to prepare dataset ourselves and later trained model on our own dataset. We learned various things from this project and hope this system will be useful for others.
